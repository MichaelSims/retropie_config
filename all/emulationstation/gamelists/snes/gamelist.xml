          <name>Animaniacs (USA)</name>
          <desc>Animaniacs is a video game that is based on the hit animated series of the same name. Unlike regular platform games, the player usually runs from the enemies rather than fighting them. Characters include Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, Pinky and the Brain, most of the supporting cast, as well as Ralph, the Warner Brothers studio guard. Animaniacs was made into two games which bore no relation to each other in terms of gameplay, despite both being made by Konami. One was for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the other was for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Game Boy. The SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis version were released in 1994, and the Game Boy version in 1995.</desc>

          <desc>THE LEGACY CONTINUES!&#xA;Every once in awhile a game comes out that is so good, people can&#39;t stop talking about it - a game that seems to rise above the others. ACTRAISER for the SNES was that game. We don&#39;t need to remind you of how good the graphics were. We don&#39;t have to tell you about the music. We could have just sat back and been satisfied with the recognition it&#39;s received. Instead, we decided to make something even better: ACTRAISER 2! We&#39;ve improved the graphics, improved the sound and created a game we&#39;re confident will once again set the standard for all SNES games.&#xA;&#xA;HE&#39;S BACK!&#xA;The most feared demons of all time have combined their power and raised the Lord of Evil, TANZRA. Now alive, TANZRA&#39;s hatred for you runs eternal. Vowing revenge, he has sent his demons to attack your people and destroy everything! You must put an end to this once and for all. This time however, it won&#39;t be easy!</desc>

          <desc>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.&#xA;&#xA;The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.&#xA;&#xA;The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</desc>

          <name>Mario&#39;s Early Years - Preschool Fun (USA)</name>
          <desc>In PRESCHOOL FUN, children develop concepts through the exploration of shapes, colors, sounds, opposites, and numbers. With Mario&#39;s help, your child learns to define and identify these subjects without pressure. Your child simply guides Mario, selecting objects on the screen which Mario bonks and bounces through, frequently affirming your child&#39;s correct choice. With Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and all their friends as classmates, your child just may make the biggest stride since learning to walk.&#xA;&#xA;That&#39;s because MARIO&#39;S EARLY YEARS is all about learning to think in a way that doesn&#39;t seem like learning, but much more like playing. Moms and Dads get to interact and play, too. Mario invites them to join in the fun and observe their kids as they become totally involved in the learning process.</desc>

          <desc>In 1982, a sequel to the  incredibly popular Pac-Man was introduced in the form of his girlfriend, Ms. Pac-Man.  This sequel continued on the &#34;eat the dots/avoid the ghosts&#34; gameplay of the original game, but added new features to keep the title fresh.&#xA;&#xA;Like her boyfriend, Ms. Pac-Man attempts to clear four various and challenging mazes filled with dots and ever-moving bouncing fruit  while avoiding Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Sue, each with their own personalities and tactics.  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.&#xA;&#xA;Ms. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost&#39;s eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.&#xA;&#xA;Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of &#34;Junior&#34;.</desc>

          <desc>Mickey&#39;s Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They&#39;ll find five characters from the Disney&#39;s universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.&#xA;&#xA;Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle&#39;s paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they&#39;ll receive a gift.&#xA;&#xA;After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy&#39;s task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.</desc>

          <name>Pac-Attack (USA)</name>
          <desc>Based on Namco&#39;s Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.&#xA;&#xA;The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man&#39;s directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a &#34;wall&#34; on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.&#xA;&#xA;Also, like many puzzlers, it contains a versus mode against another human player. It&#39;s similar to the many versus modes of puzzle games: eat plenty of ghosts and your opponent will recieve many ghosts on his area.&#xA;&#xA;The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man&#39;s direction with the press of a button.&#xA;&#xA;All of the handheld versions (including the one on Pac-Man Collection) lack the versus mode.</desc>

          <desc>Yoshi&#39;s Cookie is a fast-paced puzzle game that can be enjoyed by everyone as it is easy to play, but challenging to complete. To play, you move the randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When you successfully assemble a row or column of the same cookies, the line will disappear, and you can begin on a new row or column. The &#34;Yoshi&#34; cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since the Yoshi Cookie is the key to both games, you must use it wisely.</desc>
